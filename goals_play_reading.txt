1. make it usable for all plays
   X- take command line input of text file name
   X- take user input for character names
   X- convert user input to all caps to match script
    - program finds all the characters names


2. additional functionality
    - count how many lines each character has, not just how many times they start talking
        - could count lines for that character until the name of a new character occurs
        - 
   X (list) - 2D array for character names and line count?
   X - output shows how many lines each character has in high to low order
        - doesn't need to be a complicated algorithm, find the biggest, put it first, etc.
    - figure out who is talking to who
        - which characters share scenes
    - have names left alligned and have \t afterwards to align numbers after
    - make testing program that can run several test script versions and run test cases

3. potentially lofty goals
    - take input of how many actors there will be
        - divide up characters evenly between actors based on line counts
    - make a new script with actor names assigned to characters


ASSUMPTIONS:
    - file input is a text file
    - characters are denoted by entirely capitalized names
        ex: LORD GORING vs. Lord Goring
    - at least 2 actors
